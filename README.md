## üîÑ How to Update Team Member Information

The content of the **Team** section is managed through a local Excel spreadsheet. This method allows content updates without touching the source code.

### üìÅ Step-by-step Workflow

1. **Edit the Excel file locally**:
   
   File location:
        updateINFO/data/file_team.xlsx


2. **Run the Python script to generate a JSON file**:

```shell
cd updateINFO
python3 generate_team_json.py
```

This will create a new file:
```
public/data/team.json
```

3. Upload the JSON to the web server via SSH:

```shell
scp public/data/team.json username@your.server:/path/to/website/public/data/
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you do not edit the JSON file manually. All updates should come from the Excel spreadsheet + Python script.


## How to access to the members' database?
Through secure shell connection
```shell
ssh username@websitedomain.ub 
```
Then, edit the `current` attribute in database file via:
```shell
nano public/team.ts            
```
Write the changes and close the file. The update will take place automatically.
