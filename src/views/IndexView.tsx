          The main objective of the research group is to study the biodiversity
          of marine organisms and the evolutionary processes that generate it.
          Our lines of research cover a wide range of topics, from ecology and
          anthropogenic impact to aspects related to systematics, connectivity,
          conservation, genomics and adaptation, in keystone or invasive species
          globally, but with special attention to biodiversity hotspots. Our
          research aims at addressing scientific and societal challenges
          regarding marine biodiversity and evolution such as: 1) increase the
          knowledge on systematics of poorly known groups and habitats, 2) study
          population connectivity in keystone species, 3) understand the
          adaptation capacity of native and invasive organisms, 4) monitor the
          colonization process of endangered species, and 5) analyse how species
          and communities will face and behave in front of perturbations of
          their environment in the current scenario of global change.
