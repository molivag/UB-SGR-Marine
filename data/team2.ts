    description: `My research lines focus on the analysis of evolutionary processes and population genetic studies with different native and introduced taxa, including marine invertebrates and vertebrates, and a few other non-model yet ecologically very interesting species. We have analysed genetic connectivity among populations using different molecular markers and revealed the role of marine currents modifying gene flow in space and time. Adaptation is a key issue on a changing environment, and I am interested in identifying genes under selection and study their variation along geographic gradients. In laboratory and natural studies, we have shown that most changes occur within the first generations, indicating that both selection and drift act shaping the genetic makeup of populations. In the last years, I am interested in genomic techniques that we have applied to improve the knowledge of adaptation and dispersal in our endangered, commercial, invasive and ecosystem engineer species.`

    description: `I have been a diver since long before I became a biologist. There is nothing I enjoy more than diving, and my interest in marine invertebrate communities — their biology and ecology — stems from the many observations I had the opportunity to make during my early diving years.

My first studies focused on the meiofauna of photophilic algae. My PhD thesis centered on soft-bottom communities in the Ebre Delta (Tarragona, Spain), where I primarily worked on the taxonomy of marine nematodes, the most important group in the meiobenthos. I have always been interested in the interactions occurring in these soft-bottom environments between meiofauna and macrofauna, particularly in areas under stress, often due to human activities. These studies have allowed me to participate in several oceanographic surveys — one of the aspects of marine research I enjoy the most. During one of these expeditions aboard the BIO Hespérides, I took part in two Antarctic surveys as part of the Bentart project.

My current research focuses on marine coastal communities, particularly Mediterranean echinoderm populations (such as the sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula, and the starfish Echinaster sepositus and Coscinasterias tenuispina). Thanks to funding from several projects, we have studied many aspects of their biology, ecology, phylogeography, and population structure, using genetic tools as an essential part of our research. I have also worked with metabarcoding to characterize marine communities.

Exploring the underwater world in various parts of the globe has made me deeply aware of the need to respect and protect the marine environment. Achieving this requires a thorough understanding of marine communities and their interactions. Identifying potential environmental disturbances and contributing to the conservation of benthic species will be one of my primary goals in future research.`

The organisms I work with are sea urchins, fish, and holothurians. `

    description: `I  am a marine biologist with a degree in marine sciences and a master’s degree in biodiversity. My research focuses on applying whole genome sequencing techniques to investigate the evolutionary relationships and invasion pathways of ascidians. My background includes studying the seasonal diversity of microbial communities inhabiting invasive ascidians and utilizing bioinformatics tools to analyze the population genetic structure of gutless oligochaetes and their symbiotic microbial partners. `

    description: `I am a biologist who graduated from the University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU) and specialised in Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Barcelona (UB). Currently, I am a PhD student at the same institution. My research aims to address the reasons behind the recent colonization of the western Mediterranean by the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) through a combination of genomic, geometric morphometry, and stable isotope analysis techniques. To achieve this, my first objective is to assess the number of breeding individuals and the connectivity among nesting regions. Secondly, I aim to identify the origin of the colonization events and the foraging grounds of the nesting females. Finally, I will cross-reference this information to evaluate the impact of female foraging strategies and the origin of the colonizers on nesting reproductive parameters.`

    description: `I am a marine biologist specializing in Oceanography and Marine Environmental Management, with expertise in sea turtle genetics, ecology, and conservation. My experience spans monitoring nesting females and foraging males of species like Lepidochelys olivacea, Chelonia mydas, and Eretmochelys imbricata in Costa Rica, satellite tracking Caretta caretta in Italy, and conservation work in North Cyprus, where I conducted nest excavations and tissue sampling of females and hatchlings for genomic studies.
During my master’s thesis, I analyzed the origin of Caretta caretta and Chelonia mydas at a Mediterranean foraging ground. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at the University of Barcelona, focusing on the foraging grounds of these species in the Mediterranean and Spanish Atlantic coast, employing 2bRAD genomics techniques to inform conservation efforts.`
